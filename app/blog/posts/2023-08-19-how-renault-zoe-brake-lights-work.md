title: 'How Renault Zoe Brake Lights Work'

I recently bought a Renault Zoe electric car and when I saw the
[Technology Connections video about electric car brake lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0YW7x9U5TQ)
it made me wonder how my car handles the brake lights. In particular, I wanted
to know whether the brake lights do actually illuminate if you slow down via
regenerative braking rather than applying the friction brakes.

Unfortunately my google skills failed me and I wasn't able to find a definitive
answer online, only forum posts where people were asking and didn't receive a
satisfactory answer. So I decided to test it myself by driving around in the
dark and looking for the reflection of the brake lights!

There are still a few cases I need to test, and I'll update this post once I do.

## In regular driving mode (D)

- The brake lights illuminate when you press the brake pedal.
- _Yet to be determined:_ What happens if you lift off the accelerator?

## In regenerative braking mode (B)

- The brake lights illuminate when you press the brake pedal.
- When you lift your foot off the accelerator to slow down, there's a short
  delay (~1 second) and then the brake lights illuminate.

## With auto-hold enabled

- When auto-hold engages, the brake lights stay illuminated until the brakes are
  released.
- _Yet to be determined:_ What happens when the car automatically applies the
  parking brake?

## When the car is in neutral (N)

- _Yet to be determined:_ What happens when the car automatically applies the
  parking brake?

## When the car is in park (P)

- _Yet to be determined:_ Do the brake lights stay on if you manually engage
  park?
