Nearly 7 years ago I made [a post about my "go pack"](/blog/2018/12/28/go-pack),
a bag I take when I travel that includes all the tech stuff I need for overnight
trips. It's been so long since then that I no longer own anything that charges
using a lightning cable, so I thought it was a good time to write an update post
with the current state of my go pack.

1. [Maange makeup bag](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09F33XWZ8) — £10 for two

   I replaced the bag itself with a slightly smaller one in a much nicer colour.
   I no longer carry enough cables to charge two peoples' devices, because I've
   made a second go pack for my partner so we can travel separately.

2. [MINIX 100W 4-port GaN wall charger](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09JKJ1QRJ)
   – £55

   Since iPhones and apple watches now come with usb-c charging cables, I
   swapped the previous usb-a charger with one that focuses on usb-c. This one
   has three usb-c ports and one usb-a port (just in case), which is enough to
   charge my phone, my watch, and one other usb-c device (usually my iPad). It
   supports up to 100W simultaneously, although it gets split between all the
   connected devices.

   It's a north american plug by default, but has quick-swap adapters for EU and
   UK plugs, so I can use it pretty much anywhere I plan to travel without
   needing an external adapter.

3. Generic HDMI cable

   It's just a random HDMI cable I found in the drawer. Used to watch videos on
   hotel TVs from my iPad.

4. Lenovo usb-c hub — no longer available

   I used to have one of these for my laptop, but now it's for my iPad so I can
   connect an HDMI cable and a power cable at the same time.

5. [Spigen apple watch charger stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0109I9W24/)
   — £14

   The only thing that hasn't changed since last time! It works just as well
   with my apple watch series 10 as it did with whatever watch I had back then.
   The only difference is now it's paired with a braided usb-c cable (the one
   that came in the apple watch box).

6. Apple braided usb-c cable

   The cable with usb-c at both ends that came in the box with my iPhone. I use
   it to—surprisingly—charge my phone.

7. Apple non-braided usb-c cable

   Another random apple-branded cable with usb-c at both ends that came in the
   box of something or other. I use it to charge whatever third device I have,
   usually my iPad.

I've removed the earbuds and headphone jack dongle because I exclusively use
airpods for audio. The usb extension cable was also unnecessary since it was
usb-a.

The rule is still in place: nothing is allowed to be removed from this bag
unless I'm using it while travelling. It ensures I never leave home without
everything I need, and means packing only involves one quick and easy step.
