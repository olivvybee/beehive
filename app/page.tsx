        Hi, I'm Liv, and welcome to my beehive! Around the internet, I'm known
        as olivvybee.

        I'm <a href="https://new.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender">agender</a> and my
        pronouns are <strong>she/they</strong>. I tend to refer to myself as a
        trans woman, although it's a bit more complicated than that.

      I'm a software engineer from the south east of the UK. I mostly focus on
      frontend development now, but I started out as a full stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I'm a frontend engineer at{' '}
      <a href="https://octopus.energy">
        Octopus Energy <span role="presentation">üêô</span>
      </a>{' '}
      working on tools for engineers to upgrade homes to use green energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously I was a full stack engineer at the Lego Group, specifically
      working on the My Account section of{' '}
      <a href="https://lego.com">lego.com</a>. If you saw some changes to the
      order history, order tracking, or wishlist pages in 2022 or 2023, that
      might have been me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my programming is done in <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>{' '}
      and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a>, both at work
      and at home. I'm an aspiring iOS developer too, although I've not made
      much progress yet - but watch this space! Take a look at the{' '}
      <Link href="/code">code page</Link> to see what I've been working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from the code, I like to cross stitch, 3D print, bake, and play board
      and video games. Some things I've made are on the{' '}
      <Link href="/crafts">crafts page</Link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online, the best place to find me to see what I'm up to or have a chat is
      on the fediverse, where I'm{' '}
      <a href="https://meow.woem.cat/@olivvybee" rel="me">
        @olivvybee@meow.woem.cat
